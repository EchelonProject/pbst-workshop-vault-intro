* Your Name
* Job Title
* Secrets Management Experience
* Favorite Text Editor

???
* Use this slide to introduce yourself, give a little bit of your background story, then go around the room and have all your participants introduce themselves.

* The favorite text editor question is a good ice breaker, but perhaps more importantly it gives you an immediate gauge of how technical your users are.

**There are no wrong answers to this question. Unless you say Notepad. Friends don't let friends write code in Notepad.**

**If you don't have a favorite text editor, that's okay! Our cloud lab has Visual Studio Code preinstalled. VSC is a free programmer's text editor for Microsoft, and it has great Terraform support. Most of this workshop will be simply copying and pasting code, so if you're not a developer don't fret. Terraform is easy to learn and fun to work with.**
